When you live in a rented house in one city (due to work or other reasons) and have purchased a house in another city, **you can claim tax benefits for both the scenarios**:

1. **House Rent Allowance (HRA)** for the rent paid.  
2. **Deduction for Home Loan** under **Section 24(b)** and **Section 80C** for the purchased house.

Here's how it works:

---

### **1. Claim HRA for the Rent Paid**
If you are living in a rented house, you can claim **House Rent Allowance (HRA)** as a deduction under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act, provided you meet the following conditions:  
- You are a salaried employee receiving HRA as part of your salary package.  
- You are actually paying rent for your accommodation.  

The deduction is the **least of the following**:  
- **Actual HRA received** from the employer.  
- **50% of salary** (if living in a metro city) or **40% of salary** (for non-metro city).  
- **Rent paid minus 10% of salary**.

---

### **2. Claim Home Loan Benefits for the Purchased House**
Even if the purchased house is located in another city and **not self-occupied**, you can still claim deductions for the home loan as follows:

#### **a. Section 24(b): Deduction for Interest on Home Loan**
- **Interest paid on home loan** can be claimed as a deduction up to â‚¹2,00,000 per year, even if the house is vacant or rented out.  
- If the house is **let out**, there is **no upper limit** for claiming interest paid (actual interest paid can be claimed).  

#### **b. Section 80C: Deduction for Principal Repayment**
- Principal repayment of the home loan can be claimed as a deduction under Section 80C, up to a maximum limit of **â‚¹1,50,000** per year.  
- This includes amounts paid for stamp duty, registration charges, and the principal component of EMIs.

---

### **3. Conditions to Note**
1. **HRA and Home Loan Interest**: There is no restriction on claiming HRA and home loan interest deductions simultaneously. You can claim both if you live in a rented property while your owned property is in another city.  
2. **Declaration**: You must provide proof of rent payments (rent receipts) and home loan details (interest certificate) to claim these benefits.  
3. **House Let-Out/Vacant**:  
   - If the purchased house is **let out**, rental income must be added to your income under "Income from House Property."  
   - If the house is **vacant**, the notional rent (deemed rental income) may need to be considered as income.  

---

### **Example Calculation**

Assume:  
- **You live in a rented house** and pay â‚¹15,000 per month as rent.  
- You receive HRA of â‚¹20,000 per month.  
- You purchased a house in another city and pay an EMI of â‚¹25,000, where:  
   - Interest component = â‚¹2,50,000 annually.  
   - Principal component = â‚¹1,20,000 annually.  

---

**Step 1: Claim HRA**  
Assume your salary (Basic + DA) is â‚¹50,000 per month.  
HRA exemption = Least of the following:  
1. Actual HRA received = â‚¹20,000 Ã— 12 = â‚¹2,40,000.  
2. 40% of salary = 40% of â‚¹6,00,000 = â‚¹2,40,000.  
3. Rent paid - 10% of salary = (â‚¹1,80,000 - â‚¹60,000) = â‚¹1,20,000.  

**HRA Deduction = â‚¹1,20,000**.  

---

**Step 2: Home Loan Benefits**  
1. **Section 24(b): Interest on Loan**  
   Deduction for interest paid = **â‚¹2,00,000** (maximum for self-occupied or vacant house).  

2. **Section 80C: Principal Repayment**  
   Deduction for principal repayment = **â‚¹1,20,000**.  

---

### **Total Tax Benefits**  
1. HRA Deduction = **â‚¹1,20,000**  
2. Section 24(b) (Interest on Loan) = **â‚¹2,00,000**  
3. Section 80C (Principal Repayment) = **â‚¹1,20,000**  

**Total Deductions = â‚¹4,40,000**  

---

### **Key Points to Remember**  
1. You can **simultaneously claim HRA** and **home loan benefits** if you are staying in a rented house and your own house is in another city.  
2. Ensure you have proper **documentation**:  
   - Rent receipts for HRA.  
   - Home loan certificate for interest and principal repayment.  
3. If the purchased house is **let out**, you must declare the rental income under "Income from House Property."

When a **house property is wholly let out**, it means the entire property is rented to a tenant, and the owner earns rental income. This rental income is taxable under the **Income from House Property** head as per the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how taxation is calculated for a wholly let-out house property:

---

### **1. Annual Value of the Property**
The annual value is the potential income the property can generate. For a wholly let-out property, it is **the actual rent received/receivable**.

If the rent received is less than the fair rental value due to vacancy, then the actual rent received is considered.

---

### **2. Deductions under Section 24**
Two deductions are allowed under Section 24:

#### a. **Standard Deduction**
- **30% of Net Annual Value** (NAV) is allowed as a deduction for repairs, maintenance, etc.
- No bills or proof of expenses are required.

#### b. **Interest on Home Loan (if applicable)**
- Interest paid on loans taken for **purchase, construction, or renovation** of the house is allowed as a deduction.
- **Maximum limit for interest deduction**:
  - â‚¹2,00,000 per annum for a self-occupied property.
  - **No upper limit for let-out property**; the actual interest paid can be claimed.

---

### **3. Computation of Taxable Income**
The formula for **Income from House Property** is:

**Gross Annual Value (GAV)**  
â€” Municipal Taxes paid  
= **Net Annual Value (NAV)**  
â€” Standard Deduction (30% of NAV)  
â€” Interest on Home Loan  
= **Income from House Property**

---

### **Example Calculation**

Suppose you wholly let out a house property with the following details:  
- **Rent received**: â‚¹4,00,000 per year  
- **Municipal taxes paid**: â‚¹20,000  
- **Interest on home loan**: â‚¹1,50,000  

**Step 1: Calculate Net Annual Value (NAV)**  
GAV = â‚¹4,00,000  
â€” Municipal taxes = â‚¹20,000  
**NAV = â‚¹3,80,000**  

**Step 2: Deductions under Section 24**  
- Standard Deduction = 30% of â‚¹3,80,000 = â‚¹1,14,000  
- Interest on home loan = â‚¹1,50,000  

**Step 3: Income from House Property**  
NAV â€” Standard Deduction â€” Interest on Home Loan  
= â‚¹3,80,000 â€” â‚¹1,14,000 â€” â‚¹1,50,000  
= **â‚¹1,16,000**  

Thus, â‚¹1,16,000 is taxable under **Income from House Property**.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. Rent received/receivable is the basis for calculating income.  
2. 30% standard deduction is mandatory and applies only to Net Annual Value.  
3. Deduction for **interest on home loan** is allowed without an upper limit for let-out properties.  
4. Municipal taxes are deducted only if they are paid during the financial year.  

Let me know if you need help with calculations or any specific scenarios! ðŸ˜Š

When a **house property is partly let out and partly self-occupied**, the taxation of the property is split based on the **usage of the property**. Each portion is treated separately for the purpose of calculating income under the **Income from House Property** head as per the Income Tax Act.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

---

## **1. Treatment of Partly Let Out and Partly Self-Occupied Property**

- **Let-Out Portion**: The portion that is rented out will be taxed as a let-out property.  
- **Self-Occupied Portion**: The portion used by the owner for their own residence is treated as self-occupied.

---

## **2. Computation for Each Portion**

The **income from house property** is calculated separately for the let-out and self-occupied portions, and the results are added together.

### a. **For Let-Out Portion**
The computation follows the same rules as a wholly let-out property:

- **Gross Annual Value (GAV)** = Actual rent received/receivable.  
- **Municipal Taxes** = Deduct the proportionate amount of taxes paid for the let-out portion.  
- **Net Annual Value (NAV)** = GAV - Municipal Taxes.  
- **Deductions under Section 24**:  
   - Standard Deduction = **30% of NAV**.  
   - Interest on Loan = Proportionate interest on home loan applicable to the let-out portion.  

---

### b. **For Self-Occupied Portion**
For the self-occupied portion:  
- **Gross Annual Value** = **Zero** (as there is no rental income).  
- **Municipal Taxes** = Not applicable.  
- **Deductions under Section 24**:  
   - **Interest on Home Loan**: Maximum deduction of **â‚¹2,00,000** per annum for a self-occupied property.  

> Note: If the total interest on the loan is to be divided, the interest amount will be apportioned based on the area or value of each portion.

---

## **3. Steps to Calculate Income from Partly Let-Out Property**

1. Calculate the **income from the let-out portion**.  
2. Calculate the **income (or loss) from the self-occupied portion**.  
3. Add both incomes together to arrive at the **Net Income from House Property**.

---

## **Example Calculation**

Suppose a house property is divided into **2 equal portions**:  
- **One portion is let-out** with an annual rent of â‚¹2,40,000.  
- **The other portion is self-occupied**.  
- Municipal taxes paid for the whole property = â‚¹20,000.  
- Interest on home loan for the whole property = â‚¹3,00,000.

---

### **Step 1: Let-Out Portion**  
Since the let-out portion is 50% of the property:  
- **GAV** = â‚¹2,40,000 (rent received).  
- **Municipal Taxes** = 50% of â‚¹20,000 = â‚¹10,000.  
- **NAV** = â‚¹2,40,000 - â‚¹10,000 = â‚¹2,30,000.  
- **Standard Deduction** = 30% of â‚¹2,30,000 = â‚¹69,000.  
- **Interest on Loan** = 50% of â‚¹3,00,000 = â‚¹1,50,000.  

Income from Let-Out Portion:  
**NAV - Standard Deduction - Interest**  
= â‚¹2,30,000 - â‚¹69,000 - â‚¹1,50,000 = **â‚¹11,000**.

---

### **Step 2: Self-Occupied Portion**  
For the self-occupied portion:  
- **GAV** = â‚¹0.  
- **Interest on Loan** = 50% of â‚¹3,00,000 = â‚¹1,50,000.  
- Maximum deduction for interest = **â‚¹2,00,000**, but since interest here is â‚¹1,50,000, the entire amount is deductible.

Loss from Self-Occupied Portion = **â‚¹1,50,000**.

---

### **Step 3: Total Income from House Property**  
Add the results from both portions:  
- **Income from Let-Out Portion** = â‚¹11,000.  
- **Loss from Self-Occupied Portion** = -â‚¹1,50,000.  

**Net Income from House Property** = â‚¹11,000 - â‚¹1,50,000 = **-â‚¹1,39,000** (Loss).  

This loss can be set off against income from other heads up to â‚¹2,00,000.

---

## **Key Points to Remember**
1. Split the property into let-out and self-occupied portions based on area, value, or usage.  
2. Calculate the income/loss separately for each portion.  
3. Apportion **municipal taxes** and **interest on loan** based on the propertyâ€™s split.  
4. Combine the results to determine the **net income/loss** under house property.
