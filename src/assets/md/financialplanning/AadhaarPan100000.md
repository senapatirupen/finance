Got it 👍
Let’s break down what your scenario would mean:

---

## 1. Initial Setup

* **Eligibility trigger**: As soon as Aadhaar and PAN are linked, ₹1,00,000 is credited to the individual’s account.
* **Restriction**: The credited amount cannot be spent until further notice. It works as a "blocked principal," but it can generate returns through systematic investments.

---

## 2. Monthly Automatic Investments

* **₹1,000 SIP → NPS Tier 1 Account**

  * Tier 1 is the *retirement-focused* account. Lock-in till age 60, with some partial withdrawal rules.
  * Benefit: Tax deduction up to ₹50,000 under section 80CCD(1B).

* **₹500 SIP → NPS Tier 2 Account**

  * Tier 2 is a *voluntary* account, flexible withdrawal anytime.
  * No tax benefit, but adds liquidity and diversification.

So, every month **₹1,500** gets invested out of the blocked ₹1,00,000.

---

## 3. Cash Flow and Balance

* Yearly outflow: ₹18,000 (12 months × ₹1,500).
* After 5 years: ₹90,000 invested (still ₹10,000 idle).
* After \~55 months (4 years, 7 months), the initial ₹1,00,000 will be fully allocated into NPS Tier 1 & Tier 2.

## 4. Benefits of This Mechanism

1. **Forced disciplined investment** – People can’t spend the money recklessly; instead, it builds their retirement fund.
2. **Long-term wealth creation** – Assuming 10% CAGR for Tier 1 equity allocation, ₹1,000 monthly SIP for 30 years → \~₹22 lakh corpus.
3. **Liquidity + flexibility** – Tier 2 offers partial liquidity while Tier 1 builds retirement wealth.
4. **Financial inclusion** – Linking Aadhaar and PAN ensures identity verification and direct credit to genuine accounts.

## 5. Possible Extensions

* Government could **match contribution** for first 3 years to encourage participation.
* Idle balance could be placed in **Liquid Mutual Fund** till full utilization instead of staying stagnant.
* Gamification: People who continue linking + investing may get **extra incentives like bonus units** in Tier 1.

👉 In essence, this idea combines **identity compliance + financial discipline + retirement planning** in one scheme.

Would you like me to **design a projection Excel sheet** showing how the ₹1,000 (Tier 1) and ₹500 (Tier 2) grow over 10, 20, and 30 years with different CAGR assumptions (like 8%, 10%, 12%)? That way you can visualize the corpus creation.
