Based on the presentation, taxation on long-duration debt funds is more tax-efficient due to **indexation benefits**, especially when held for more than three years. Here's how it works:

### Components for Calculation
1. **Initial Investment (Principal):** The amount invested.
2. **Indexed Cost of Acquisition:** Adjusted for inflation using the Cost Inflation Index (CII).
3. **Capital Gains:** Calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the indexed cost of acquisition.
4. **Tax Rate:** For long-term capital gains, typically **20% with indexation benefits**.

### Example Scenario:
Suppose:
- Amount Invested: ₹1,00,000
- Investment Period: 10 years
- Annualized Return: 7%
- Applicable Tax Rate: 20.80% (20% + cess)

---

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Gross Value at Maturity**  
   \[
   \text{Gross Value} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Annualized Rate})^{\text{Years}}
   \]  
   \( ₹1,00,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} = ₹1,96,715 \)

2. **Indexed Cost of Acquisition**  
   Use an assumed average inflation rate of 5%.  
   \[
   \text{Indexed Cost} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Inflation Rate})^{\text{Years}}
   \]  
   \( ₹1,00,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{10} = ₹1,62,889 \)

3. **Capital Gains**  
   \[
   \text{Capital Gains} = \text{Gross Value} - \text{Indexed Cost}
   \]  
   \( ₹1,96,715 - ₹1,62,889 = ₹33,826 \)

4. **Tax Liability**  
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Capital Gains} \times \text{Tax Rate}
   \]  
   \( ₹33,826 \times 20.80\% = ₹7,036 \)

5. **Post-Tax Value**  
   \[
   \text{Post-Tax Value} = \text{Gross Value} - \text{Tax}
   \]  
   \( ₹1,96,715 - ₹7,036 = ₹1,89,679 \)
