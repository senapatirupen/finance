The difference between **loan part payment to reduce tenure vs. reduce EMI** is critical in home loan management — and impacts your **total interest outgo**, **loan duration**, and **monthly burden**.

## 🔍 What is Loan Part Payment?

Part-payment means paying a **lump sum** toward your home loan principal before the actual tenure ends. You can choose to:

* ✅ **Reduce EMI** (Equated Monthly Installment)
* ✅ **Reduce Tenure** (Loan duration)

## 🆚 Reduce EMI vs. Reduce Tenure — What's the Difference?

| **Option**          | **What it does**                  | **Impact on Interest**                | **Monthly Burden**  | **Loan Duration**                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Reduce EMI**    | Lowers your monthly EMI           | **Moderate savings** on interest      | Easier on cash flow | Tenure remains same (or slightly increases) |
| ✅ **Reduce Tenure** | Keeps EMI same, but shortens loan | **Maximum savings** on total interest | Same monthly burden | **Loan closes earlier**                     |

| EMI               | ₹66,880     |
| Total Interest    | ₹80.5 Lakhs |
| Total Outgo       | ₹1.6 Cr     |
