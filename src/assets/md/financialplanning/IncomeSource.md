To create a calculator that computes the total amount received from various income sources where the income grows annually, we can follow these steps:

1. Update the logic to compute the monthly income and total income for each year.
2. Accumulate the total income received over the specified number of years.
3. Reflect these computations in the Angular component and template.

### TypeScript Logic

**income-calculator.component.ts**:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-income-calculator',
  templateUrl: './income-calculator.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./income-calculator.component.css']
})
export class IncomeCalculatorComponent {
  incomeSources: any[] = [];
  totalInitialIncome: number | null = null;
  totalProjectedIncome: number | null = null;
  totalAmountReceived: number | null = null;

  addIncomeSource() {
    this.incomeSources.push({
      sourceName: '',
      initialMonthlyIncome: null,
      annualGrowthRate: null,
      years: null,
      projectedMonthlyIncome: null,
      totalAmountReceived: null
    });
  }

  removeIncomeSource(index: number) {
    this.incomeSources.splice(index, 1);
    this.calculateTotalIncome();
  }

  calculateIncomeDetails(incomeSource) {
    if (incomeSource.initialMonthlyIncome && incomeSource.annualGrowthRate && incomeSource.years) {
      incomeSource.projectedMonthlyIncome = incomeSource.initialMonthlyIncome * Math.pow(1 + incomeSource.annualGrowthRate / 100, incomeSource.years);
      incomeSource.totalAmountReceived = 0;
      let monthlyIncome = incomeSource.initialMonthlyIncome;
      for (let i = 0; i < incomeSource.years; i++) {
        incomeSource.totalAmountReceived += monthlyIncome * 12;
        monthlyIncome *= 1 + incomeSource.annualGrowthRate / 100;
      }
    }
  }

  calculateTotalIncome() {
    this.totalInitialIncome = 0;
    this.totalProjectedIncome = 0;
    this.totalAmountReceived = 0;

    this.incomeSources.forEach(incomeSource => {
      this.calculateIncomeDetails(incomeSource);
      this.totalInitialIncome += incomeSource.initialMonthlyIncome * 12;
      this.totalProjectedIncome += incomeSource.projectedMonthlyIncome * 12;
      this.totalAmountReceived += incomeSource.totalAmountReceived;
    });
  }
}
```

### HTML Template

**income-calculator.component.html**:
```html
<div class="container mt-5">
  <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Income Calculator</h2>
  <form (ngSubmit)="calculateTotalIncome()">
    <div *ngFor="let incomeSource of incomeSources; let i = index" class="income-input">
      <h4>Income Source {{ i + 1 }}</h4>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="sourceName{{i}}">Source Name:</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="sourceName{{i}}" name="sourceName{{i}}" [(ngModel)]="incomeSource.sourceName" required>
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="initialMonthlyIncome{{i}}">Initial Monthly Income (INR):</label>
        <input type="number" class="form-control" id="initialMonthlyIncome{{i}}" name="initialMonthlyIncome{{i}}" [(ngModel)]="incomeSource.initialMonthlyIncome" required>
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="annualGrowthRate{{i}}">Annual Growth Rate (%):</label>
        <input type="number" class="form-control" id="annualGrowthRate{{i}}" name="annualGrowthRate{{i}}" [(ngModel)]="incomeSource.annualGrowthRate" required>
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="years{{i}}">Number of Years:</label>
        <input type="number" class="form-control" id="years{{i}}" name="years{{i}}" [(ngModel)]="incomeSource.years" required>
      </div>
      <div class="income-summary">
        <p>Projected Monthly Income: {{ incomeSource.projectedMonthlyIncome | currency:'INR':true:'1.0-2' }}</p>
        <p>Total Amount Received: {{ incomeSource.totalAmountReceived | currency:'INR':true:'1.0-2' }}</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" (click)="removeIncomeSource(i)">Remove Income Source</button>
      <hr>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block" (click)="addIncomeSource()">Add Income Source</button>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success btn-block mt-3">Calculate Total Income</button>
  </form>
  <div *ngIf="totalProjectedIncome !== null" class="mt-4">
    <h4>Total Initial Income (Annually): {{ totalInitialIncome | currency:'INR':true:'1.0-2' }}</h4>
    <h4>Total Projected Income (Annually): {{ totalProjectedIncome | currency:'INR':true:'1.0-2' }}</h4>
    <h4>Total Amount Received: {{ totalAmountReceived | currency:'INR':true:'1.0-2' }}</h4>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Explanation

1. **TypeScript Logic**:
    - `initialMonthlyIncome` is the initial monthly income.
    - `projectedMonthlyIncome` is the projected monthly income after the specified number of years, accounting for annual growth.
    - `totalAmountReceived` is the total income received over the specified number of years, calculated using a loop to account for the annual growth.
    - `calculateIncomeDetails` method calculates the projected monthly income and total amount received.
    - `calculateTotalIncome` method sums the initial annual income, projected annual income, and total amount received for all income sources.

2. **HTML Template**:
    - Inputs for `initialMonthlyIncome`, `annualGrowthRate`, and `years` for each income source.
    - Displays the projected monthly income and total amount received for each income source.
    - Displays the total initial annual income, total projected annual income, and total amount received for all income sources.

This setup accurately reflects the annual growth of monthly income and the cumulative total amount received over the specified period.
