### Detailed Breakdown

#### Savings

1. **Short-term Savings:**
   - **Savings Account:** Keep your short-term savings in a high-interest savings account for easy access and liquidity. This can include emergency fund top-ups, planned purchases, and small financial goals.
   - **Recurring Deposits (RD):** Consider opening RDs for disciplined savings towards specific short-term goals. They offer better interest rates than regular savings accounts.

2. **Medium-term Savings:**
   - **Fixed Deposits (FD):** Suitable for goals 1-3 years away. FDs offer higher interest rates than savings accounts and are relatively safe.
   - **Debt Mutual Funds:** For goals 3-5 years away, debt funds offer better returns than FDs with moderate risk. Consider short-term or medium-term debt funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Gold Savings:** If you have a cultural or investment preference for gold, consider Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) or gold ETFs for better returns than physical gold.

3. **Long-term Savings:**
   - **Public Provident Fund (PPF):** Continue contributing to your PPF for long-term, tax-free savings. It's a safe investment with decent returns.
   - **National Savings Certificate (NSC):** Suitable for risk-averse investors, offering fixed returns and tax benefits under Section 80C.
   - **Equity Mutual Funds:** Consider SIPs in equity mutual funds for long-term wealth creation. Equity tends to outperform other asset classes over the long run.
   - **Employee Provident Fund (EPF):** If you are salaried, ensure your EPF contributions are maximized.

#### Debt Repayment

1. **High-interest Debt:**
   - **Credit Cards:** Focus on paying off credit card balances first. Credit card debt typically has high interest rates (18-42% per annum). Aim to pay more than the minimum due to reduce the principal faster.
   - **Personal Loans:** Prioritize repayment of personal loans as they generally have higher interest rates compared to secured loans. Make extra payments whenever possible to reduce the principal and interest burden.

2. **Low-interest Debt:**
   - **Home Loans:** Continue making regular EMI payments. If you have extra funds after clearing high-interest debt, consider making prepayments on your home loan to reduce the loan tenure and total interest paid.
   - **Education Loans:** Maintain regular payments as per the schedule. Some education loans offer a moratorium period, but it’s advisable to start payments as soon as possible to reduce interest accumulation.
   - **Car Loans:** Make regular EMI payments. If you have excess funds, consider prepaying, but prioritize other high-interest debts first.
