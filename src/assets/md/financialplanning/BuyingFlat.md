To calculate the total amount you need to pay in the **1st year of buying the flat**, we will consider the following costs step-by-step:

---

### **1. Initial Cost Breakup**
- **Flat Price**: ₹1,00,00,000  
- **Initial Down Payment (20%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 20% = **₹20,00,000**  
- **Loan Amount (80%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 80% = **₹80,00,000**  

#### **Additional Charges**:
1. **Agreement Fee (0.5%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 0.5% = **₹50,000**  
2. **Tripartite Agreement (0.5%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 0.5% = **₹50,000**  
3. **Registration Fee (7%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 7% = **₹7,00,000**  
4. **Government Tax (1%)** = ₹1,00,00,000 × 1% = **₹1,00,000**  

#### **Interior and Furniture Costs**:
- **Interior Work** = ₹15,00,000  
- **Furniture** = ₹10,00,000

### **2. Loan EMI Calculation for 1st Year**
To calculate the EMI for a loan of ₹80,00,000 at an **8.5% annual interest rate** for **20 years**, we use the EMI formula:

\[
EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:  
- \(P\) = Loan Amount = ₹80,00,000  
- \(r\) = Monthly Interest Rate = 8.5% ÷ 12 = 0.708% = 0.00708  
- \(n\) = Total Months = 20 × 12 = 240 months  

Let's calculate the EMI.

The EMI for a loan of ₹80,00,000 at 8.5% annual interest for 20 years is **₹69,426 per month**.  
The total EMI payments in the 1st year = **₹8,33,110**.

---

### **3. Maintenance Fee**
- Maintenance Fee = ₹4 per sqft × 1200 sqft = **₹4,800 per month**  
- Total Maintenance for 1st year = ₹4,800 × 12 = **₹57,600**

---

### **4. Total Payments in 1st Year**
Now, summing up all costs:

| **Cost Description**                     | **Amount (₹)**       |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Initial Down Payment (20%)              | ₹20,00,000          |
| Agreement Fee (0.5%)                    | ₹50,000             |
| Tripartite Agreement Fee (0.5%)         | ₹50,000             |
| Registration Fee (7%)                   | ₹7,00,000           |
| Government Tax (1%)                     | ₹1,00,000           |
| Interior Work                           | ₹15,00,000          |
| Furniture                               | ₹10,00,000          |
| EMI Payments (1st Year)                 | ₹8,33,110           |
| Maintenance Fee (1st Year)              | ₹57,600             |
| **Total**                               | **₹62,90,710**      |

---

### **Final Answer**:
The total amount you need to pay in the **1st year** of buying this flat is **₹62,90,710**.

To calculate your **profit in the 2nd year**, we will consider:

1. **Flat Price Appreciation**: 9% annual increase in the flat price.  
2. **Income Tax Savings**: ₹2,00,000 saved.  
3. **Rent Savings**: ₹30,000 per month (₹30,000 × 12 months).  
4. **EMI Payments**: Continued loan EMI for the 2nd year.  
5. **Maintenance Costs**: Continued maintenance fee for the 2nd year.  

---

### **1. Flat Price Appreciation**
The flat price increases by **9% annually**.  
- Flat Price = ₹1,00,00,000  
- Price Increase = ₹1,00,00,000 × 9% = ₹9,00,000  
- New Flat Price at the end of Year 2 = ₹1,00,00,000 + ₹9,00,000 = **₹1,09,00,000**  

---

### **2. Rent Savings**
You save ₹30,000 per month in rent:  
- Total Rent Savings in Year 2 = ₹30,000 × 12 = **₹3,60,000**  

---

### **3. Income Tax Savings**
You save **₹2,00,000** in income tax.

---

### **4. EMI Payments**
The EMI remains **₹69,426 per month**.  
- Total EMI Payments in Year 2 = ₹69,426 × 12 = **₹8,33,110**  

---

### **5. Maintenance Fee**
The maintenance cost is ₹4 per sqft for 1200 sqft:  
- Maintenance Fee per Month = ₹4,800  
- Total Maintenance in Year 2 = ₹4,800 × 12 = **₹57,600**  

---

### **6. Profit Calculation**
Now, let’s calculate your **net profit**:  

**Profit** = (Flat Price Appreciation) + (Rent Savings) + (Income Tax Savings) - (EMI Payments) - (Maintenance Cost)  

Substitute the values:  
**Profit** = ₹9,00,000 + ₹3,60,000 + ₹2,00,000 - ₹8,33,110 - ₹57,600  

Let’s calculate this.

### **Profit in the 2nd Year**:
You will make a net profit of **₹5,69,290** in the 2nd year.

To calculate your savings in the **3rd year**, let’s consider the following factors:

1. **Flat Price Appreciation**: The flat price will again increase by **9%** over the **2nd year's price**.  
2. **Rent Savings**: Continued savings of ₹30,000 per month.  
3. **Income Tax Savings**: ₹2,00,000 in tax savings.  
4. **EMI Payments**: Continued loan EMI.  
5. **Maintenance Cost**: ₹4,800 per month.  

---

### **1. Flat Price Appreciation in 3rd Year**
The flat price at the end of **2nd year** is **₹1,09,00,000**.  
- Appreciation in the 3rd year = ₹1,09,00,000 × 9% = ₹9,81,000  
- New Flat Price = ₹1,09,00,000 + ₹9,81,000 = ₹1,18,81,000  

---

### **2. Rent Savings in 3rd Year**
You continue to save ₹30,000 per month on rent:  
- Total Rent Savings = ₹30,000 × 12 = **₹3,60,000**

---

### **3. Income Tax Savings**
You save **₹2,00,000** in income tax in the 3rd year.

---

### **4. EMI Payments**
The EMI remains **₹69,426 per month**:  
- Total EMI Payments = ₹69,426 × 12 = **₹8,33,110**

---

### **5. Maintenance Cost**
Maintenance Fee = ₹4,800 per month:  
- Total Maintenance = ₹4,800 × 12 = **₹57,600**

---

### **6. Profit Calculation for the 3rd Year**
**Profit** = (Flat Price Appreciation) + (Rent Savings) + (Income Tax Savings) - (EMI Payments) - (Maintenance Cost)  

Substitute the values:  
**Profit** = ₹9,81,000 + ₹3,60,000 + ₹2,00,000 - ₹8,33,110 - ₹57,600  

Let’s calculate this.

### **Profit in the 3rd Year**:
You will make a net profit of **₹6,50,290** in the 3rd year.


### **1. Profit in the 4th Year**
For the 4th year:
- Flat price appreciation continues at 9%.
- Rent savings are ₹30,000 per month.
- Income tax savings are ₹2,00,000.
- EMI payments and maintenance costs remain constant.

Flat price appreciation in the 4th year:
\[
\text{Appreciation} = \text{Price at end of 3rd year} \times 9\%
\]
From the file:
- Flat price at the end of 3rd year = ₹1,18,81,000.
- Appreciation = ₹1,18,81,000 × 9% = ₹10,69,290.
- New flat price = ₹1,18,81,000 + ₹10,69,290 = ₹1,29,50,290.

Total profit calculation for the 4th year:
\[
\text{Profit} = (\text{Flat Price Appreciation}) + (\text{Rent Savings}) + (\text{Income Tax Savings}) - (\text{EMI Payments}) - (\text{Maintenance Cost})
\]
Substituting:
\[
\text{Profit} = ₹10,69,290 + ₹3,60,000 + ₹2,00,000 - ₹8,33,110 - ₹57,600 = ₹7,38,580.
\]

---

### **2. Profit in the 5th Year**
Flat price appreciation in the 5th year:
\[
\text{Appreciation} = \text{Price at end of 4th year} \times 9\%
\]
From the 4th year:
- Flat price at the end of 4th year = ₹1,29,50,290.
- Appreciation = ₹1,29,50,290 × 9% = ₹11,65,526.
- New flat price = ₹1,29,50,290 + ₹11,65,526 = ₹1,41,15,816.

Profit calculation for the 5th year:
\[
\text{Profit} = ₹11,65,526 + ₹3,60,000 + ₹2,00,000 - ₹8,33,110 - ₹57,600 = ₹8,34,816.
\]

---

### **3. Total Investment at the End of 5th Year**
- **Total Down Payment:** ₹20,00,000.
- **Agreement and Additional Costs:** ₹50,000 + ₹50,000 + ₹7,00,000 + ₹1,00,000 = ₹9,00,000.
- **Interior and Furniture:** ₹15,00,000 + ₹10,00,000 = ₹25,00,000.
- **EMI Payments for 5 Years:** ₹8,33,110 × 5 = ₹41,65,550.
- **Maintenance Costs for 5 Years:** ₹57,600 × 5 = ₹2,88,000.

\[
\text{Total Investment} = ₹20,00,000 + ₹9,00,000 + ₹25,00,000 + ₹41,65,550 + ₹2,88,000 = ₹98,53,550.
\]

### **4. Total Profit at the End of 5th Year**
Summing up annual profits:
- Year 2: ₹5,69,290.
- Year 3: ₹6,50,290.
- Year 4: ₹7,38,580.
- Year 5: ₹8,34,816.

\[
\text{Total Profit} = ₹5,69,290 + ₹6,50,290 + ₹7,38,580 + ₹8,34,816 = ₹27,92,976.
