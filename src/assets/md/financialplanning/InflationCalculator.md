To modify the inflation calculator to calculate the future amount based on a given inflation rate and the initial amount invested, you'll need to update the Angular component accordingly. Below is the step-by-step guide to achieve this.

### Step 1: Modify the Component Template

1. **Update `inflation-calculator.component.html` to include the inflation rate input and display the future amount:**

   ```html
   <div class="container">
     <h1>Inflation Calculator</h1>
     <form (ngSubmit)="calculateFutureAmount()">
       <div>
         <label for="initialAmount">Initial Amount:</label>
         <input type="number" id="initialAmount" [(ngModel)]="initialAmount" name="initialAmount" required>
       </div>
       <div>
         <label for="inflationRate">Inflation Rate (% per year):</label>
         <input type="number" id="inflationRate" [(ngModel)]="inflationRate" name="inflationRate" required>
       </div>
       <div>
         <label for="years">Number of Years:</label>
         <input type="number" id="years" [(ngModel)]="years" name="years" required>
       </div>
       <button type="submit">Calculate Future Amount</button>
     </form>

     <div *ngIf="futureAmount !== null">
       <h2>Future Amount: {{ futureAmount | currency }}</h2>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

### Step 2: Update the Component Logic

1. **Update `inflation-calculator.component.ts` to calculate the future amount:**

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-inflation-calculator',
     templateUrl: './inflation-calculator.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./inflation-calculator.component.css']
   })
   export class InflationCalculatorComponent {
     initialAmount: number = 0;
     inflationRate: number = 0;
     years: number = 0;
     futureAmount: number | null = null;

     calculateFutureAmount() {
       if (this.initialAmount && this.inflationRate && this.years) {
         const rate = this.inflationRate / 100;
         this.futureAmount = this.initialAmount * Math.pow(1 + rate, this.years);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. **Ensure your Angular development server is running:**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. **Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser** to see the updated inflation calculator.

### Step 4: Explanation of the Logic

- **Formula for Future Amount Calculation:**

  The future amount is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Future Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Inflation Rate}}{100}\right)^{\text{Years}}
  \]

  - `Initial Amount`: The amount you have invested or want to calculate the future value for.
  - `Inflation Rate`: The average annual inflation rate, expressed as a percentage.
  - `Years`: The number of years you want to project into the future.

This formula takes into account compound inflation, where the inflation rate is applied every year to the growing amount.

### Step 5: Further Enhancements

- **Validation:** Ensure that all inputs are valid and handle edge cases (e.g., negative values).
- **Styling:** Enhance the visual design for better user experience.
- **Unit Tests:** Consider adding unit tests to validate the calculation logic.

This setup will allow you to calculate the future value of an investment based on a given inflation rate using Angular.
