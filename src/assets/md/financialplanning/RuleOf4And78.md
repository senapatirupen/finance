### **Rule of 78: Example**

The Rule of 78 is used to calculate interest on loans with a fixed term, particularly when they are paid off early. It’s based on a method called "sum-of-the-digits" where more interest is allocated in the earlier months of the loan.

#### **Example Scenario:**
- **Loan Amount**: $12,000
- **Loan Term**: 12 months
- **Interest Rate**: 10% per annum
- **Total Interest**: $1,200

#### **Steps:**
1. **Calculate the Total Payments**: The borrower will make 12 monthly payments.
2. **Sum of the Digits**: 
   - For 12 months, sum the digits: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 12 = 78 \). This is why it's called the Rule of 78.
3. **Interest Allocation**: 
   - The first month’s interest is \( 12/78 \times 1200 = \$184.62 \).
   - The second month’s interest is \( 11/78 \times 1200 = \$169.23 \).
   - And so on, with the last month being \( 1/78 \times 1200 = \$15.38 \).

If the borrower pays off the loan early, say after 6 months, under the Rule of 78, they would have paid more interest than if the interest were calculated evenly over the term of the loan.

### **Rule of 4%: Example**

The Rule of 4% is commonly used in retirement planning to estimate how much money you can withdraw annually from your retirement savings without running out of money.

#### **Example Scenario:**
- **Retirement Savings**: $1,000,000
- **Annual Withdrawal Rate**: 4%
- **Expected Inflation Rate**: 2%

#### **Steps:**
1. **First Year Withdrawal**:
   - Withdraw 4% of $1,000,000 = $40,000.
   
2. **Subsequent Years**:
   - Adjust the withdrawal amount for inflation. 
   - If inflation is 2%, in the second year, you would withdraw $40,800 ($40,000 + 2%).
   - Continue adjusting the withdrawal amount by the inflation rate each year.

The Rule of 4% suggests that if you start with a 4% withdrawal rate, your retirement savings should last for about 30 years, assuming a balanced investment portfolio.
