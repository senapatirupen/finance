**CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)** and **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)** are both metrics used to measure investment performance, but they differ in use case, especially with respect to time periods and cash flows. Let's break them down with examples.

---

### **1. CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**  
CAGR measures the **average annual growth rate** of an investment over a specific period, assuming that profits are reinvested. It assumes a **single investment made at the beginning** and redeemed at the end.  

#### **Formula:**
\[
CAGR = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
\]
Where:  
- Final Value = Value at the end of the period  
- Initial Value = Value at the start of the period  
- n = Number of years  

---

#### **CAGR Example:**
- Initial investment: Rs 1,00,000  
- Value after 3 years: Rs 1,50,000  

\[
CAGR = \left( \frac{1,50,000}{1,00,000} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 = (1.5)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 = 0.1447 = 14.47\%
\]

So, the investment grew at an **average annual rate of 14.47%** over 3 years.

### **2. XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)**  
XIRR is used to calculate the annualized return for **irregular cash flows** that occur at different times. This is more useful when there are multiple investments (like SIPs) or withdrawals made throughout the period.  

#### **Formula:**
The XIRR is a more complex calculation that requires solving for a rate \(r\) where:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{(1 + r)^{t_i}} = 0
\]

Where:  
- \(C_i\) = Cash inflow/outflow at time \(i\)  
- \(t_i\) = Fraction of the year for that cash flow  

It’s easier to calculate XIRR using tools like Excel or financial calculators.

---

#### **XIRR Example:**  
Let’s say you made multiple cash flows at irregular intervals:

| Date        | Investment (+) / Redemption (-) |  
|-------------|-------------------------------|  
| 01-Jan-2022 | Rs 50,000                     |  
| 01-Jul-2022 | Rs 30,000                     |  
| 01-Jan-2023 | Rs 20,000                     |  
| 01-Oct-2023 | Rs -1,20,000 (Redemption)    |  

To calculate XIRR:  
Using Excel, input these dates and cash flows into `=XIRR(values, dates)`.  
The result might be something like **12.65%** annualized return.

### **Key Differences:**

| **Aspect**        | **CAGR**                            | **XIRR**                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Use Case**      | Single investment and redemption   | Multiple cash flows over time      |
| **Cash Flow**     | Assumes only start and end values   | Handles irregular cash flows       |
| **Time Period**   | Fixed period (years)                | Varying time intervals             |
| **Example Use**   | Lump sum investment                | SIPs, partial withdrawals, etc.   |

---

### **When to Use CAGR vs XIRR?**  
- **CAGR**: When you have a lump sum investment with no intermediate cash flows.  
- **XIRR**: When investments are made in parts (like SIPs) or when there are withdrawals during the period.
