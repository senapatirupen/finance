| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |

| EMI Burden              | Low (₹12.5k/month)  | High (₹26.7k/month)      |
| Long-Term Asset         | Cheaper, Own Land   | Amenities + Location     |

### 📊 **Suggested Monthly Allocation (₹1,00,000 Income)**

| Purpose                           | % Allocation | Amount (₹) | Notes                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Monthly Expenses**              | 30%          | ₹30,000    | Rent, bills, groceries, transport               |
| **Index Funds (Mutual Funds)**    | 25%          | ₹25,000    | SIPs in Nifty 50, Sensex, etc.                  |
| **Gold (SGB/Digital/ETF)**        | 5%           | ₹5,000     | Long-term inflation hedge                       |
| **Liquid Fund (Emergency Fund)**  | 5%           | ₹5,000     | Low risk, quick access                          |
| **Buy Land (Retirement Home)**    | 15%          | ₹15,000    | Save monthly until downpayment ready            |
| **Direct Equity (Stocks)**        | 10%          | ₹10,000    | Only after learning, else keep in Index         |
| **NPS / PPF (Retirement Corpus)** | 10%          | ₹10,000    | Tax saving + pension (NPS) or secure 7-8% (PPF) |

✅ You can slightly **rebalance each year** based on market performance or goals (e.g., when land is purchased, shift that 15% to home construction or retirement funds).

---

### 🔁 **Yearly Goals**

1. **Emergency Fund**: 6 months of expenses in Liquid Funds (build slowly).
2. **Land for Retirement**: Plan for downpayment in 5–7 years.
3. **PPF**: ₹1.5L/year max limit → ₹12,500/month for tax saving and safe corpus.
4. **NPS**: Tier I for ₹50,000/year extra tax benefit under 80CCD(1B).
5. **Index Funds**: Let compounding work. Target 12–15% CAGR.
6. **Direct Equity**: Only if you have time/skill to research.

---

### 🧠 Additional Tips

* Use **auto-SIPs and auto-transfers** to reduce decision fatigue.
* Reinvest **yearly bonuses** into land purchase or lump-sum investments.
* Once land is bought, shift savings to **home building or rental yield** planning.
* Consider **health + term insurance** (if not done yet).

Would you like an **Excel template** or a **10-year projection sheet** with these allocations and returns?

Here's the **10-year future value** of your monthly investments with the assumed CAGR:

| Investment        | Monthly Amount (₹) | CAGR | Future Value in 10 Years (₹) | In Lakhs |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| **Index Fund**    | 25,000             | 15%  | ₹65,75,455                   | ₹65.75L  |
| **Land Fund**     | 15,000             | 10%  | ₹30,21,864                   | ₹30.22L  |
| **Direct Equity** | 10,000             | 17%  | ₹29,28,684                   | ₹29.29L  |
| **NPS / PPF**     | 10,000             | 8%   | ₹18,12,832                   | ₹18.13L  |

💡 **Observations**:

* **Index funds** offer the highest return with consistent SIPs.
* **Land savings** and **direct equity** come close in future value despite lower monthly investment in equity, thanks to the higher CAGR.
* **NPS/PPF** offers safer, tax-saving growth.
* **Gold**, while stable and inflation-resistant, gives relatively lower returns.
