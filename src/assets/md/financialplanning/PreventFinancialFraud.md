Yes — that figure is reported in multiple media sources, citing data disclosed by the Indian government. ([The Times of India][1])

Here’s more context and a breakdown:

---

## ✅ The Figures & Source

* In 2024, Indians lost **₹22,845.73 crore** to cyber frauds, according to a reply in Parliament by the Ministry of Home Affairs. ([Business Standard][2])
* In 2023, the corresponding loss was **₹7,465.18 crore**. ([Business Standard][2])
* This implies a year-on-year increase of about **206%** (i.e. more than triple) in the financial losses due to cyber frauds. ([The Times of India][1])
* Also, the number of **financial fraud incidents** reported via cybercrime portals (NCRP + CFCFRMS) in 2024 was about **36,37,288** (i.e. ~36.37 lakh) compared to **24,42,978** in 2023. ([Business Standard][2])

---

## ⚠ Caveats & Points to Note

* These figures refer to **reported** cyber frauds. The actual amounts lost may be higher, since many cases go unreported.
* The data is aggregated from two portals: NCRP (National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal) and CFCFRMS (Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting & Management System). ([Business Standard][2])
* The government also claims that using the CFCFRMS, more than **₹5,489 crore** was prevented (i.e. intercepted, frozen, or reversed) in 2024 via early reporting and intervention. ([Business Standard][2])
* The sharp rise partly reflects increased digital transactions, more people online, growing sophistication of frauds, and better reporting mechanisms.

Excellent question — prevention is the **most critical layer** in fighting financial and cyber frauds.
Let’s look at this comprehensively, divided into 4 levels: **(1) Individual/User**, **(2) Bank/Institution**, **(3) Corporate/Business**, and **(4) Government/Systemic** measures.

---

## 🧠 1. For Individuals / Citizens

### 🔐 **Digital Security Hygiene**

* **Never share OTP, PIN, CVV, passwords, or UPI PIN** — even with “bank officers” or “police”.
* **Avoid clicking suspicious links** from SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, or emails.
* **Use official apps only** — download banking or UPI apps only from verified Play Store/App Store developers.
* **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for banking, investment, and email accounts.
* **Use strong passwords** — mix letters, numbers, and special characters; never reuse across sites.
* **Lock SIM and device** with passcodes or biometric authentication.

### 🧾 **Transaction Awareness**

* **Set real-time alerts** (SMS/email) for every debit or credit.
* **Regularly review bank and credit card statements** — even small unexplained charges can be signs of fraud.
* **Avoid public Wi-Fi** for any financial transaction.
* **Never share screen via apps like AnyDesk or TeamViewer** with unknown callers — scammers use this to hijack accounts.

### 💡 **Investment Caution**

* **If it sounds too good to be true, it is.** Be wary of guaranteed high-return schemes.
* **Verify company registration** via MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and SEBI if it’s an investment platform.
* **Avoid fake stock trading or crypto apps.** Check if it’s SEBI/Exchange-regulated.
* **Be cautious with online job / loan / dating / parcel / police call scams.**

### 🚨 **If Fraud Happens**

1. **Immediately call 1930** (National Cyber Crime Helpline).
2. **File a complaint on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in)**.
3. **Inform your bank within 24 hours** — faster reporting increases refund chances.
4. **Freeze your account or block cards** until investigation is done.

## 🏦 2. For Banks / Financial Institutions

* **AI-based fraud monitoring** to detect unusual patterns or geolocation mismatches.
* **Velocity and behavioral checks** for abnormal UPI or NEFT activity.
* **Regular KYC updates and verification** to prevent mule accounts.
* **24x7 fraud reporting teams** connected to CFCFRMS (Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting & Management System).
* **Public education campaigns** — SMS/email advisories, posters, awareness drives.
* **Instant account freeze coordination** across banks when flagged through 1930/CFCFRMS.

---

## 🏢 3. For Companies / Businesses

* **Segregate financial duties** — never let one employee handle invoices, payments, and reconciliation alone.
* **Use secure payment gateways** and audit them regularly.
* **Train employees on phishing and social engineering.**
* **Install endpoint protection and anti-malware software** on all systems.
* **Encrypt sensitive financial and customer data.**
* **Use approval workflows** (multi-level) for high-value fund transfers.
* **Conduct quarterly internal and external audits.**

---

## 🏛️ 4. Government / Systemic Actions

* **National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP)** integration with all major banks.
* **CFCFRMS** (Real-time fund freezing system) — already saved ₹5,489 crore in 2024.
* **AI-based scam detection systems** monitoring call/SMS/spam campaigns.
* **Mandatory forensic audits** for large frauds (>₹50 crore).
* **Enhanced coordination among RBI, SEBI, ED, and State EOWs.**
* **Public awareness initiatives** like “Cyber Jaagrookta Divas” and mass media campaigns.
