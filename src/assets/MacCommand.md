Would you like more details on any command? üöÄ

To see all software you‚Äôve installed via Homebrew, you can run:

```bash
brew list
```

That will list all installed formulae (command-line tools) and casks (GUI apps) together.

---

### If you want them separated:

**Formulae only (CLI tools):**

```bash
brew list --formula
```

**Casks only (GUI apps):**

```bash
brew list --cask
```

---

### If you want versions too:

```bash
brew list --versions
```

or separately:

```bash
brew list --formula --versions
brew list --cask --versions
```

---

If you want a **full list with description**:

```bash
brew info --installed
```

---

Do you want me to also give you a **command that exports this list so you can reinstall everything on another Mac**? That‚Äôs handy for backups.

Once you‚Äôve installed **MongoDB Compass** with:

```bash
brew install --cask mongodb-compass
```

You can open it in a few ways:

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£ From Terminal:**

```bash
open -a "MongoDB Compass"
```

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ From Spotlight Search (Cmd ‚åò + Space):**
Type **MongoDB Compass** and hit **Enter**.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ From Applications Folder:**

* Go to **Finder ‚Üí Applications**
* Double-click **MongoDB Compass**.

---

Once it opens:

* Click **New Connection**
* Enter your connection string, e.g.

  ```
  mongodb://localhost:27017
  ```
* Click **Connect** to view your databases and collections.

---

Do you want me to give you the **Mongo Express setup** as well so you can view MongoDB in your browser instead of opening Compass? That way you can use either method.

Sure ‚Äî let‚Äôs go through **all the commands I mentioned** earlier step by step, and I‚Äôll explain what each one does in the context of your MongoDB setup and the error you got.

---

## **1. Checking your current MongoDB installation**

```bash
brew list
```

* **Purpose:** Shows all software installed via Homebrew.
* Useful to confirm if MongoDB (`mongodb-community`) is installed.
* Example output:

  ```
  mongodb-community  node  git
  ```

---

```bash
brew list --versions
```

* **Purpose:** Shows installed packages **with versions**.
* Example output:

  ```
  mongodb-community 8.0.12
  ```

---

## **2. Uninstalling incompatible MongoDB**

You got this error:

```
built for macOS 14.0 which is newer than running OS
```

So we remove the current version before installing a compatible one.

```bash
brew uninstall mongodb-community
```

* **Purpose:** Removes the installed MongoDB formula.
* Example:

  ```
  Uninstalling /opt/homebrew/Cellar/mongodb-community/8.0.12... (20 files, 500MB)
  ```

---

## **3. Tapping MongoDB‚Äôs official formula repository**

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
```

* **Purpose:** Adds MongoDB‚Äôs official Homebrew ‚Äútap‚Äù (repository) so you can install older or specific versions like `mongodb-community@7.0`.

---

## **4. Installing a compatible MongoDB version**

```bash
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```

* **Purpose:** Installs MongoDB 7.0, which is compatible with macOS 13 (Ventura) and avoids the symbol not found error.
* Example:

  ```
  ==> Installing mongodb-community@7.0
  üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/mongodb-community@7.0/7.0.12: 20 files, 500MB
  ```

---

## **5. Starting MongoDB as a background service**

```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

* **Purpose:** Starts MongoDB automatically in the background on boot.
* Example:

  ```
  Successfully started `mongodb-community@7.0` (label: homebrew.mxcl.mongodb-community@7.0)
  ```

---

## **6. Running MongoDB manually**

```bash
mongod --dbpath /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

* **Purpose:** Starts MongoDB manually using a specific data directory.
* Use this if you don‚Äôt want it running as a background service.
* Example:

  ```
  {"t":{"$date":"2025-08-14T15:00:00.000Z"},"s":"I", "c":"CONTROL",  "id":23456, "ctx":"main","msg":"Waiting for connections","attr":{"port":27017}}
  ```

---

## **7. Installing MongoDB Compass (GUI)**

```bash
brew install --cask mongodb-compass
```

* **Purpose:** Installs MongoDB‚Äôs official GUI for browsing and editing data.
* `--cask` is for GUI apps, `--formula` is for CLI tools.

---

## **8. Opening MongoDB Compass**

```bash
open -a "MongoDB Compass"
```

* **Purpose:** Opens Compass from Terminal.
* Alternatively:

  * Press **Cmd + Space**, type **MongoDB Compass**, and press **Enter**.
  * Or go to **Finder ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí MongoDB Compass**.

---

## **9. Connecting in Compass**

Inside Compass:

* In **New Connection**, enter:

  ```
  mongodb://localhost:27017
  ```
* Click **Connect** to see all your databases and collections.

---

‚úÖ Following these commands in sequence will:

1. Remove the incompatible MongoDB version.
2. Install a version matching your macOS.
3. Start MongoDB so it‚Äôs ready for connections.
4. Give you a GUI (Compass) to explore your data.

---

If you want, I can also add **Mongo Express setup** to this list so you have a **browser-based MongoDB UI** without needing to open Compass. That could be useful when you‚Äôre testing APIs.

Got it ‚Äî you want to know **other `sudo` commands** that could come into play during MongoDB setup or troubleshooting.
Normally, Homebrew avoids `sudo` for installing packages, but there are some cases where you might need it, especially if:

* You installed MongoDB manually (not via Homebrew)
* Your data directory permissions are wrong
* You‚Äôre running `mongod` directly without a Homebrew service

---

## **Common `sudo` Commands in MongoDB Setup & Fixes**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check MongoDB service status (system-wide)**

```bash
sudo launchctl list | grep mongo
```

* Lists all running services and filters for `mongo`.
* Useful if MongoDB was installed as a system daemon outside of Homebrew.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start MongoDB manually as root**

```bash
sudo mongod --dbpath /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

* Forces `mongod` to run with root privileges (usually not recommended unless testing).
* Sometimes necessary if `/opt/homebrew/var/mongodb` has root-only permissions.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Fix MongoDB data directory permissions**

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

* Gives your user account full access to the MongoDB data directory.
* Prevents "permission denied" errors when `mongod` starts.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Create the MongoDB data directory**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

* Creates the directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
* Needed when setting a custom `--dbpath`.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Change permissions for the data directory**

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

* Ensures `mongod` can read and write to the directory.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Stop MongoDB system-wide**

```bash
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongodb.mongod.plist
```

* Stops a MongoDB instance that was installed manually and running as a system daemon.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Check which process is using port 27017**

```bash
sudo lsof -i :27017
```

* Shows which process is bound to MongoDB‚Äôs default port.
* If another process is using it, you‚Äôll see its PID.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Kill a stuck MongoDB process**

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

* Force-stops the MongoDB process when it won‚Äôt shut down normally.

---

üí° **Best practice:**
Use `sudo` only when dealing with system services, permissions, or processes. For Homebrew-managed MongoDB, most commands won‚Äôt need it because Homebrew keeps everything in `/opt/homebrew` under your user account.

---

If you want, I can make you a **MongoDB Setup Cheat Sheet** that includes *both* the Homebrew commands **and** these `sudo` commands so you have one quick reference file. That way you won‚Äôt have to look them up again.

Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step-by-step and cover **all the relevant macOS M1 (Apple Silicon) commands** you might use during MongoDB installation, troubleshooting, and running, explained with **examples** just like I did earlier.

Since you‚Äôre on a **Mac M1**, the paths and architecture are slightly different from Intel Macs:

* Homebrew is in `/opt/homebrew` (not `/usr/local`).
* ARM binaries sometimes cause compatibility issues, so you may need to run things in **Rosetta**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Homebrew installation**

```bash
brew --version
```

**Purpose:** Confirms Homebrew is installed and working.
Example:

```
Homebrew 4.3.9
Homebrew/homebrew-core (no Git repository)
Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision c0b1; last commit 2025-08-14)
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Show where Homebrew is installed**

```bash
which brew
```

Example output on M1:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew
```

If it shows `/usr/local/bin/brew`, you‚Äôre running the Intel version.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ List installed software**

```bash
brew list
```

Example:

```
git
node
mongodb-community
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ List with versions**

```bash
brew list --versions
```

Example:

```
mongodb-community 8.0.12
node 22.3.0
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Remove a package**

```bash
brew uninstall mongodb-community
```

Example output:

```
Uninstalling /opt/homebrew/Cellar/mongodb-community/8.0.12... (500MB)
```

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Add MongoDB‚Äôs official repo**

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
```

Example:

```
==> Tapping mongodb/brew
Cloning into '/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/mongodb/homebrew-brew'...
Tapped 8 formulae (39 files, 200KB).
```

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Install a specific version (macOS 13 compatible)**

```bash
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```

Example:

```
üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/mongodb-community@7.0/7.0.12: 20 files, 500MB
```

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Start MongoDB as a background service**

```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

Example:

```
==> Successfully started `mongodb-community@7.0` (label: homebrew.mxcl.mongodb-community@7.0)
```

---

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the background service**

```bash
brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0
```

Example:

```
Stopping `mongodb-community@7.0`... (might take a while)
```

---

## **üîü Run MongoDB manually**

```bash
mongod --dbpath /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

Example:

```
{"t":{"$date":"2025-08-14T15:00:00.000Z"},"s":"I","c":"CONTROL","id":23456,"ctx":"main","msg":"Waiting for connections","attr":{"port":27017}}
```

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a data directory (if missing)**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

Example: *(no output if successful)*

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix ownership (M1 Homebrew user)**

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

Example: *(no output if successful)*

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Check if MongoDB is running**

```bash
ps aux | grep mongod
```

Example:

```
youruser   5056   0.3  0.1  408636  1440   ??  S     1:03PM   0:03.21 mongod --dbpath /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
```

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Find what‚Äôs using port 27017**

```bash
sudo lsof -i :27017
```

Example:

```
mongod  5056 youruser   15u  IPv4 0x12345678      0t0  TCP *:27017 (LISTEN)
```

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Kill a stuck MongoDB process**

```bash
sudo kill -9 5056
```

*(Replace 5056 with the PID from the previous command.)*

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Install MongoDB Compass GUI**

```bash
brew install --cask mongodb-compass
```

Example:

```
==> Downloading https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongodb-compass-1.39.0-darwin-arm64.dmg
üç∫  mongodb-compass was successfully installed!
```

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Open MongoDB Compass**

```bash
open -a "MongoDB Compass"
```

Example: *(GUI launches with connection screen)*

---

üí° On **Mac M1**, you also have the special case where you might need to run MongoDB under **Rosetta** if some dependencies are Intel-only. For that:

```bash
arch -x86_64 brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```

This forces Homebrew to install the Intel version inside `/usr/local` instead of `/opt/homebrew`.

---

If you want, I can now make you a **single MongoDB M1 Setup & Fix cheat sheet** with *both* these commands and explanations, so next time you can copy-paste them in order without rethinking the sequence. This would be super handy when you reinstall or upgrade macOS.
