            <h4>Ways To Maximize Profit From MF Investment</h4>
            <p>Their are various ways to maximize profit from MF Investment, Let discuss those in detail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch">
                <div class="icon-box">
                    <h5><a>Guidelines</a></h5>
                    <p>To maximize profits in mutual fund (MF) investments, consider the following approach:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Set your SIP date after the 20th of every month to coincide with the monthly Future and
                        Option expiry, as it is believed that the market may go down during this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Use the SIP method for regular investments and add lump sum payments once a month when you
                        observe the market going down by at least 2% from its monthly high.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Aim to stay invested in MF for a minimum of one year to disqualify for the lower tax rate
                        (15%)
                        on Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) in India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. After one year of investment, if you decide to withdraw, you'll be subject to a 10% tax on
                        Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) applicable to profits exceeding 1 lakh rupees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. If your MF returns exceed 20%, you may consider redeeming that 20% capital gain to purchase
                        desired goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. During market corrections or recessions, when NAVs are lower, consider investing more in MF
                        to buy more units, which could lead to higher returns when the market rebounds in the next 2 to
                        3 years.
