                    <p><em class="heading">Inflation:</em> The purchasing power of a currency reduces over time due to
                        the effect of
                        inflation. Inflation is the increase in the general price level of goods and services in an
                        economy, which means that the same amount of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did
                        in the past.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let's break down some example to understand how inflation and interest rates impact various
                        aspects of the economy:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Fixed Deposit Interest Rate (6%):</em>
                        Suppose a bank offers a fixed deposit with an annual interest rate of 6%. If the inflation rate
                        in the economy is also around 6%, it means that the real return on the fixed deposit is close to
                        zero. In other words, the purchasing power of the money deposited in the fixed deposit remains
                        relatively stable, but it does not provide significant real growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you deposit ₹100,000 in a fixed deposit with a 6% interest rate for a year, you will
                        earn ₹6,000 in interest. However, due to the 6% inflation rate, the value of ₹106,000 after one
                        year may not have increased significantly in terms of purchasing power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Home Loan Interest Rate (7%):</em>
                        When a bank offers a home loan at a 7% interest rate, it means that borrowers will have to pay
                        an additional 7% on top of the principal amount borrowed. The higher the interest rate, the
                        higher the overall cost of the home loan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a home loan of ₹1,000,000 at a 7% interest rate for 20 years, you will have
                        to pay ₹1,000,000 (principal) + ₹700,000 (interest) = ₹1,700,000 in total over the loan tenure.
                        However, if the home price inflation rate is also around 7%, the value of the property you
                        purchase may have increased by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Education Loan Interest Rate (10%):</em>
                        When a bank provides an education loan at a 10% interest rate, students or their parents will
                        need to repay the loan with an additional 10% interest on top of the borrowed amount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take an education loan of ₹500,000 at a 10% interest rate for 5 years, you will
                        have to repay ₹500,000 (principal) + ₹250,000 (interest) = ₹750,000. However, if the education
                        expenditure inflation rate is also around 10%, the overall cost of education may have increased
                        by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Gold Loan Interest Rate (8%):</em>
                        A gold loan is secured by gold, and the interest rate is typically lower compared to other types
                        of loans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a gold loan of ₹200,000 at an 8% interest rate for 1 year, you will have to
                        repay ₹200,000 (principal) + ₹16,000 (interest) = ₹216,000. However, if the gold buying price
                        inflation rate is also around 8%, the value of the gold you pledge as collateral may have
                        increased by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Car Loan Interest Rate (9%):</em>
                        When a bank provides a car loan at a 9% interest rate, borrowers will need to repay the loan
                        with an additional 9% interest on top of the principal amount borrowed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a car loan of ₹600,000 at a 9% interest rate for 3 years, you will have to
                        repay ₹600,000 (principal) + ₹162,000 (interest) = ₹762,000. However, if the car buying price
                        inflation rate is also around 9%, the cost of the car you want to buy may have increased by a
                        similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each of these examples, the impact of inflation on interest rates is evident. The rates at
                        which loans are provided and the returns on deposits are influenced by the prevailing inflation
                        rates in the economy. It is essential to consider inflation while making financial decisions to
                        understand the real value of money and assets over time.

                        Based on the analysis, the lump sum investment in a financial instrument with a 15% CAGR yields
                        a slightly higher return compared to investing in the property. However, it's essential to
                        consider the costs involved in the property purchase, such as stamp duty, registration charges,
                        and interest on the home loan. Additionally, property investments come with certain risks,
                        including potential damage due to natural disasters and increased maintenance costs over time.

                        On the other hand, the lump sum investment offers more flexibility, no maintenance costs, and
                        the potential for higher returns with a diversified investment strategy. As with any investment
                        decision, it's crucial to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon
                        before making a choice. It's also recommended to seek advice from a financial advisor to develop
                        a comprehensive investment strategy.

                        This is based on the idea that the asset is now "on sale" and might present a better buying

                        gains, allowing your investment to potentially grow further.

                            Once you have an outstanding amount left after the due date, even one rupee, you pay
                            interest from the day you transacted. Even if that transaction was BEFORE the due date.

                        <p>Sweep-in Fixed Deposits (FDs) are a financial product that allows you to link a
                            savings or current account with a fixed deposit. <em class="heading">The concept is to maintain a higher balance
                            in the savings or current account while earning higher interest on the surplus amount
                            through an FD.</em> Here's how it typically works, illustrated with an example:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's say you have a savings account with a linked sweep-in FD facility. The minimum
                            threshold for auto-sweep is set at Rs 25,000. Any amount above this threshold in your
                            savings account gets automatically transferred to an FD in multiples of Rs 1,000.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system automatically converts the surplus amount above to (Rs 25,000) into a fixed
                            deposit. You
                            now have an FD of surplus amount created with an interest rate of 6% per annum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em class="heading">The sweep-in FD allows easy access to funds when needed, as it can be automatically broken
                            to meet the requirements of the savings account.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that the specific terms and conditions of sweep-in FDs may vary among
                            banks, and individuals should carefully review the features and charges associated with the
                            product.
