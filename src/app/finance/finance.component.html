                    <p><em class="heading">Inflation:</em> The purchasing power of a currency reduces over time due to the effect of
                        inflation. Inflation is the increase in the general price level of goods and services in an
                        economy, which means that the same amount of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did
                        in the past.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let's break down some example to understand how inflation and interest rates impact various
                        aspects of the economy:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Fixed Deposit Interest Rate (6%):</em>
                        Suppose a bank offers a fixed deposit with an annual interest rate of 6%. If the inflation rate
                        in the economy is also around 6%, it means that the real return on the fixed deposit is close to
                        zero. In other words, the purchasing power of the money deposited in the fixed deposit remains
                        relatively stable, but it does not provide significant real growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you deposit ₹100,000 in a fixed deposit with a 6% interest rate for a year, you will
                        earn ₹6,000 in interest. However, due to the 6% inflation rate, the value of ₹106,000 after one
                        year may not have increased significantly in terms of purchasing power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Home Loan Interest Rate (7%):</em>
                        When a bank offers a home loan at a 7% interest rate, it means that borrowers will have to pay
                        an additional 7% on top of the principal amount borrowed. The higher the interest rate, the
                        higher the overall cost of the home loan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a home loan of ₹1,000,000 at a 7% interest rate for 20 years, you will have
                        to pay ₹1,000,000 (principal) + ₹700,000 (interest) = ₹1,700,000 in total over the loan tenure.
                        However, if the home price inflation rate is also around 7%, the value of the property you
                        purchase may have increased by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Education Loan Interest Rate (10%):</em>
                        When a bank provides an education loan at a 10% interest rate, students or their parents will
                        need to repay the loan with an additional 10% interest on top of the borrowed amount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take an education loan of ₹500,000 at a 10% interest rate for 5 years, you will
                        have to repay ₹500,000 (principal) + ₹250,000 (interest) = ₹750,000. However, if the education
                        expenditure inflation rate is also around 10%, the overall cost of education may have increased
                        by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Gold Loan Interest Rate (8%):</em>
                        A gold loan is secured by gold, and the interest rate is typically lower compared to other types
                        of loans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a gold loan of ₹200,000 at an 8% interest rate for 1 year, you will have to
                        repay ₹200,000 (principal) + ₹16,000 (interest) = ₹216,000. However, if the gold buying price
                        inflation rate is also around 8%, the value of the gold you pledge as collateral may have
                        increased by a similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em class="heading">Car Loan Interest Rate (9%):</em>
                        When a bank provides a car loan at a 9% interest rate, borrowers will need to repay the loan
                        with an additional 9% interest on top of the principal amount borrowed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="bi bi-check-circle" style="color:#ec0000"></i>
                        Example: If you take a car loan of ₹600,000 at a 9% interest rate for 3 years, you will have to
                        repay ₹600,000 (principal) + ₹162,000 (interest) = ₹762,000. However, if the car buying price
                        inflation rate is also around 9%, the cost of the car you want to buy may have increased by a
                        similar percentage over the same period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each of these examples, the impact of inflation on interest rates is evident. The rates at
                        which loans are provided and the returns on deposits are influenced by the prevailing inflation
                        rates in the economy. It is essential to consider inflation while making financial decisions to
                        understand the real value of money and assets over time.
