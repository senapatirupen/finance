        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            You have provided a scenario illustrating the relationship between spending, investing, inflation,
            and the impact of
            a favorable or unfavorable condition, such as a recession, on purchasing power. Let's break down the
            points you
            mentioned:
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            1. <em class="red">Spending vs. Investing:</em> When we earn money, we have the choice to either spend it or
            invest it.
            Spending money
            immediately means we can purchase goods and services at the present time. On the other hand,
            investing money allows
            it to grow over time, potentially increasing our purchasing power in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            2. <em class="red">Inflation:</em> Inflation refers to the decrease in the purchasing power of money over
            time. It means
            that the same
            amount of money will buy fewer goods and services in the future due to rising prices. Your example
            highlights how
            the cost of petrol has increased over five years, indicating the impact of inflation.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            3. <em class="red">Recession:</em> A recession pertains to a significant economic downturn characterized by
            a contraction
            in economic
            activity, including decreased GDP, job losses, reduced production, and negative business sentiment.
            In a recession,
            the earning sources of money can be either favorable or unfavorable.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">- Favorable Condition:</em> In a favorable condition, if your country discovers a large
            domestic source
            of petrol, it can
            lead to a cheaper supply of petrol, benefiting consumers with lower prices.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">- Unfavorable Condition:</em> In an unfavorable condition, if your country imports petrol
            from another
            country that
            experiences a war or natural disaster, the availability of petrol may be severely impacted, leading
            to scarcity and
            higher prices. In such a scenario, even if you have the money to buy petrol, it may not be possible
            due to the
            disruption in the source.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            Overall, the relationship between spending, investing, inflation, and economic conditions like
            recessions can
            significantly impact purchasing power and the availability of goods and services. It's important to
            consider these
            factors when making financial decisions and planning for the future.

        <h4>Why Recession Happen And It's Impact</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <em class="red">Causes of Recessions:</em>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            A recession is a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for an extended period, typically
            characterized by a decrease in GDP (Gross Domestic Product), increased unemployment rates, reduced consumer
            spending, and decreased business investments. Recessions can occur due to various factors, and their effects
            on society can be far-reaching. Here are some common causes of recessions and their potential effects on
            society:
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            1. <em class="red">Demand Shock:</em> A sudden decrease in consumer and business spending can lead to a
            decrease in demand for goods and services. This might occur due to factors like a financial crisis, high
            inflation rates, or increased interest rates that make borrowing more expensive.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            2. <em class="red">Supply Shock:</em> Disruptions in the supply chain, such as natural disasters,
            geopolitical conflicts, or significant changes in the global market, can lead to reduced production and
            economic slowdown.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            3. <em class="red">Financial Crisis:</em> Events like banking crises, stock market crashes, or housing
            market collapses can create instability in financial systems, leading to decreased consumer confidence and
            reduced economic activity.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Tight Monetary Policy:</em> Central banks may implement tight monetary policies by raising
            interest rates to control inflation. While this is intended to stabilize the economy, it can also lead to
            decreased consumer spending and business investments.
        </p>
        <em class="red">Effects on Society:</em>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Unemployment:</em> One of the most noticeable effects of a recession is a rise in
            unemployment. Businesses may cut jobs to reduce costs, leading to layoffs and reduced income for individuals
            and families.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Income Inequality:</em> Recessions can disproportionately impact lower-income individuals
            and families, exacerbating income inequality as they struggle to maintain their standard of living.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Consumer Spending:</em> Reduced consumer confidence and income can lead to decreased
            spending on non-essential goods and services, affecting retail, hospitality, and entertainment industries.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Business Investments:</em> During recessions, businesses may delay or cancel investments in
            new projects or expansion, leading to a slowdown in economic growth.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Housing Market:</em> Recessions can lead to a decline in the housing market, with decreased
            property values and a slowdown in real estate transactions.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Government Revenues:</em> As economic activity slows down, government tax revenues may
            decrease, affecting public services and infrastructure projects.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Mental Health:</em> Economic uncertainty, job loss, and financial stress can contribute to
            mental health issues for individuals and families.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Social Services:</em> As government revenues decrease, funding for social services like
            education, healthcare, and welfare programs might be impacted, affecting vulnerable populations.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Global Impact:</em> Recessions can have a global ripple effect, affecting trade, investment,
            and job opportunities across countries.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            <em class="red">Political Climate:</em> Economic downturns can impact political dynamics, leading to changes
            in public sentiment and potentially influencing policy decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            It's important to note that the impact of a recession can vary depending on the severity, duration, and
            region. Governments and policymakers often implement measures to mitigate the effects of recessions, such as
            fiscal stimulus packages and monetary policy adjustments, to support economic recovery and stability.
