            You have provided a scenario illustrating the relationship between spending, investing, inflation,
            and the impact of
            a favorable or unfavorable condition, such as a recession, on purchasing power. Let's break down the
            points you
            mentioned:
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            1. Spending vs. Investing: When we earn money, we have the choice to either spend it or invest it.
            Spending money
            immediately means we can purchase goods and services at the present time. On the other hand,
            investing money allows
            it to grow over time, potentially increasing our purchasing power in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            2. Inflation: Inflation refers to the decrease in the purchasing power of money over time. It means
            that the same
            amount of money will buy fewer goods and services in the future due to rising prices. Your example
            highlights how
            the cost of petrol has increased over five years, indicating the impact of inflation.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            3. Recession: A recession pertains to a significant economic downturn characterized by a contraction
            in economic
            activity, including decreased GDP, job losses, reduced production, and negative business sentiment.
            In a recession,
            the earning sources of money can be either favorable or unfavorable.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            - Favorable Condition: In a favorable condition, if your country discovers a large domestic source
            of petrol, it can
            lead to a cheaper supply of petrol, benefiting consumers with lower prices.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            - Unfavorable Condition: In an unfavorable condition, if your country imports petrol from another
            country that
            experiences a war or natural disaster, the availability of petrol may be severely impacted, leading
            to scarcity and
            higher prices. In such a scenario, even if you have the money to buy petrol, it may not be possible
            due to the
            disruption in the source.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item mb-0">
            Overall, the relationship between spending, investing, inflation, and economic conditions like
            recessions can
            significantly impact purchasing power and the availability of goods and services. It's important to
            consider these
            factors when making financial decisions and planning for the future.
